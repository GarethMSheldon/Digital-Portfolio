## 📜 CHARTER OF SERVICE

I am a **Lead Technical Engineer** and **Cybersecurity Specialist** defending complex hybrid IT and cloud environments with a focus on **FinTech realms**. I ensure infrastructure runs smoother and defends stronger than a dwarven fortress.

By day, I lead advanced technical support, fortify systems for security and stability, and serve as the final escalation for critical sieges—conducting deep-dive Root Cause Analysis for server, network, and cloud incidents.

My arsenal spans **Azure Citadel, Entra Identity Scrolls, Intune Enchantments, Microsoft Sentinel Watchtowers, Cisco Forges, Sophos Bastions, FortiGate Strongholds**, and **Kubernetes War Machines**. What sets me apart is the fusion of structured engineering logic and creative problem-solving—honed through years composing and mastering audio.

> ⚜️ *"Engineering gives me structure. Music gives me rhythm. Together, they teach me to solve every challenge with both logic and creativity."*

## 🗡️ LEGENDARY QUESTS

### 💎 Unified Watchtower Vision
**⏳ Frostfall 2025** (January 2025)
- **⚔️ The Siege:** Fragmented visibility across SentinelOne, Sophos Firewalls, and Datto RMM created monitoring blind spots
- **🛠️ The Forge:** Built centralized Grafana watchtower with custom Python scrolls, Promtail, and Loki for unified log aggregation
- **🏆 Victory Claimed:** Reduced threat detection time by 78% through correlated endpoint and network threat visualization

### 🔮 Automated Threat Intelligence Nexus
**⏳ Evening Star 2024** (November 2024)
- **⚔️ The Siege:** Manual threat intelligence ingestion delayed response to emerging dark campaigns
- **🛠️ The Forge:** Integrated Honeypot → MISP → Azure Functions (Python) → Microsoft Sentinel for automated IOC enrichment
- **🏆 Victory Claimed:** Achieved real-time correlation of live attacks with STIX/TAXII feeds, creating high-confidence KQL detection runes

### 📜 DNS Guardian Spell
**⏳ Sun's Dusk 2024** (September 2024)
- **⚔️ The Siege:** Manual verification of SPF, DMARC, and DKIM records was error-prone and time-consuming
- **🛠️ The Forge:** Developed Python enchantment (Tkinter + dnspython) for rapid DNS security protocol validation
- **🏆 Victory Claimed:** Enabled instant domain integrity verification across the realm, hardening against phishing and spoofing

### 🧪 Vulnerability Alchemy Laboratory
**⏳ Morning Star 2023** (December 2023)
- **⚔️ The Siege:** Disconnected vulnerability scanning and security monitoring created remediation delays
- **🛠️ The Forge:** Integrated Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM) with Wazuh for active scanning and real-time monitoring
- **🏆 Victory Claimed:** Automated response workflows (IP blocking, host isolation) improved remediation speed by 40%
