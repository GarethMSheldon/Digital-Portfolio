## 📜 SCROLL OF SERVICE (Mission Profile)

High Warden and Arcane Security Specialist safeguarding complex hybrid aetherial and cloud environments — with a focus on **FinTech kingdoms**. I ensure infrastructure runs smoother and defends stronger than a dwarven fortress.

By day, I lead advanced technical support, fortify environments for stringent security and stability, and serve as the final arbiter for critical sieges — performing deep-dive investigations for server, network, and aetherial incidents.

My arsenal spans **Azure Citadel, Entra Identity Scrolls, Intune Enchantments, Microsoft Sentinel Watchtowers, Cisco Forges, Sophos Bastions, FortiGate Strongholds**, and **Kubernetes Golems**. But what truly sets me apart is the fusion of structured engineering logic and creative problem-solving — honed through years composing ballads on the lute.

> *"Engineering gives me structure. Music gives me rhythm. Together, they teach me to solve every challenge with both logic and creativity."*

## ⚔️ QUEST LOG (Tactical Operations)

### 💎 Multi-Realm Scrying Crystal (Frostfall 2025)
* **🦁 Challenge:** Watchtower fatigue from siloed tools: SentinelOne (EDR), Sophos Firewall, Datto RMM.
* **🧪 Solution:** Forged centralized Grafana crystal with custom Python incantations and Promtail/Loki pipeline.
* **⚡ Impact:** Unified vision of IPS/SD-WAN anomalies & endpoint threats; cut detection time by **78%**.

### 🔮 Order of the Crystal Ball (Evening Star 2024)
* **🦁 Challenge:** Manual rune ingestion delayed response to emerging dark campaigns.
* **🧪 Solution:** Enchanted pipeline: Honeypots → MISP → Azure Functions (Python) → Microsoft Sentinel (Log Analytics).
* **⚡ Impact:** Real-time correlation of live attacker data with enriched STIX/TAXII scrolls; high-confidence KQL alerts.

### 📜 Fortress & Security Enchantments (Sun's Dusk 2024)
* **🦁 Challenge:** Manual DNS security validation (SPF/DMARC/DKIM) prone to scribe error.
* **🧪 Solution:** Developed Python alchemy (Tkinter) with dnspython for rapid verification and domain spoofing prevention.
* **⚡ Impact:** Enabled wardens to validate message integrity kingdom-wide in seconds — hardening against phishing.

### 🧪 Vulnerability Alchemy & Remediation Laboratory (Morning Star 2024)
* **🦁 Challenge:** *[Data truncated in source]*
